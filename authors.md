# About The Author

Stu's bio here.

## Acknowledgements

My thanks to Tessa-Marie Coopey and Steffan Harris for reviewing the early drafts of this book.  Their questions and comments helped to make this a much better book for you.

I'd also like to thank Dr. Peter Gradwell for introducing me to the Department of Computing at Aberystwyth University, and Dr. Adrian Shaw and Mr. Richard Shipman for inviting me back each year to teach their 2nd year students once more.

Most importantly, my thanks to my wife Kristi for all of her help and encouragement throughout this project.  Although she doesn't join us at Gregynog, she's giving up those weekends too because I'm not home with her.  I couldn't have done this without her.
