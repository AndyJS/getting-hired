## Your Next Steps

Today, this list might look somewhat daunting, if not positively overwhelming.  I can assure you that after a couple of years in the computing industry, you'll look back at this list and probably spot things that are missing from it!

The only way to tick off more of the items on the list is to put the hours in.  If you want to join the computing industry, then you should already be curious about technology and how it works.  Now you need to invest in yourself, and in your future, by learning as many of these things as you can.

My advice is to do so through a series of small projects.  A project is a great way to explore something new, because every successful project delivers something usable at the end of it.  Your mind will be engaged and focused, which in turn leads to better learning.  It's better if you come up with a real problem to solve with each project, to avoid doing things that are too simplistic to learn anything from.

However you learn, you need to repeat these skills over and over so that they stick.
