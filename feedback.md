# Feedback Most Welcome

## That's All, Folks!

You've reached the end of this e-book.  Now the onus is on you to take my advice and make good use of it when you apply for your first (or next) job in the computing industry here in the United Kingdom.  Good luck!

## Tell Me Your Story

Has this book helped you?  I've love to hear how.

Please write to me with your success stories, your horror stories, and your feedback on things that I need to update or additional things that we need to cover for next year's edition.  You can reach me at getting-hired-book (at) stuartherbert dot com, and I look forward to hearing from you.
